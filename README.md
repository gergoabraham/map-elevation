# map-elevation

The goal of this project was to have some fun with `recursion`, `HTML canvas` and `mouse events` in JavaScript.

The algorithm elevates or lowers the ground on a given coordinate, and makes sure that the difference between neighbouring coordinates (i.e. the steepness) is not too large.
